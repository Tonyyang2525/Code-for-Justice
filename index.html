    <h1>Solutions to Climate Change</h1>

    <h2>Energy Efficent</h2>

    <p class=p1>Invest in LED light bulbs! Led lightbulbs last 25 times longer than incandescent bulbs and they use 90%
        less energy! </p>

    <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
    <p>
        Transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy is the key to winning the fight against climate change. Here are
        the most common sources of renewable energy—and one source of decidedly nonrenewable energy that often gets
        included (falsely) in the list.</p>
    <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
    <p>Unlike solar panels, which convert the sun’s energy directly into electricity, wind turbines produce electricity
        more conventionally: wind turns the blades of a turbine, which spin a generator. Currently, wind accounts for
        just above 9 percent of U.S. electricity generation, but it, like solar, is growing fast as more states and
        utilities come to recognize its ability to produce 100 percent clean energy at a remarkably low cost.
        Unsurprisingly, states with plenty of wide-open space—including Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas—have huge capacity
        when it comes to wind power, but many analysts believe that some of the greatest potential for wind energy
        exists just off our coasts. Offshore wind even tends to ramp up in the evenings when home electricity use jumps,
        and it can produce energy during the rainy and cloudy times when solar energy is less available. Smart planning
        and protective measures, meanwhile, can ensure we harness the massive promise of offshore wind while limiting or
        eliminating potential impacts on wildlife.</p>

    <h2>Enviornment help</h2>
    <p>
        Some of our strongest allies in the fight against climate change are the trees, plants, and soil that store
        massive amounts of carbon at ground level or underground. Without the aid of these carbon sinks, life on earth
        would be impossible, as atmospheric temperatures would rise to levels more like those found on Venus. But
        whenever we clearcut forests for timber or rip out wetlands for development, we release that climate-warming
        carbon into the air. Similarly, the widespread overuse of nitrogen-based fertilizers (a fossil fuel product) on
        cropland and generations of industrial-scale livestock farming practices have led to the release of
        unprecedented amounts of nitrous oxide and methane, powerful greenhouse gases, into our atmosphere. We can’t
        plant new trees fast enough to replace the ones we clearcut in carbon-storing forests like the Canadian boreal
        or the Amazon rainforest—nor can rows of spindly young pines serve the same function as old-growth trees. We
        need a combination of responsible forestry policies, international pressure, and changes in consumer behavior to
        put an end to deforestation practices that not only accelerate climate change but also destroy wildlife habitat
        and threaten the health and culture of Indigenous communities that live sustainably in these verdant spaces. At
        the same time, we need to treat our managed landscapes with as much care as we treat wild ones. For instance,
        adopting practices associated with organic and regenerative agriculture—cover crops, pesticide use reduction,
        rotational grazing, and compost instead of synthetic fertilizers—will help nurture the soil, yield healthier
        foods, and pay a climate dividend too.</p>
